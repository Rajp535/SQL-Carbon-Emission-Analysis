# 🌍 Carbon Emissions Analysis with SQL

## 📌 Objective
To perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis on global carbon dioxide emissions data using SQL, and identify trends, growth rates, and reduction strategies over time.

## 🛢️ Dataset
- **Emissions Data:** `Carbon Dioxide Emission Estimates.csv`
- **Carbon Reduction Methods:** `reduce_Carbon.csv`
- **Tables:**
  - `emissions` (CO2 emission estimates, Year, Series, Value)
  - `reduced_carbon` (Type, Reduced Carbon(Gt), How)

## 🧠 SQL Concepts Applied
- Database and Table Creation
- Loading CSV Data into MySQL Tables
- Data Cleaning (checking for missing values)
- Joins between Tables
- Grouping, Aggregation (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Window Functions (`LAG()` for Growth Rate Analysis)
- Calculating Percentage Reductions
- Ordering and Filtering Results
- Subqueries and Aliases for Readability

## 📈 Key Analyses
- Total carbon emissions in a given year (e.g., 1975).
- Number of emission records for a specific year (e.g., 2017).
- Top 3 countries with the highest emissions in 2016.
- Average emissions over the years for a specific country (e.g., Zimbabwe).
- Growth rate of average emissions compared to previous years.
- Average emissions per type of reduction strategy.
- Calculating and ranking the percentage reduction contributed by each method.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL:** MySQL 8.0
- **Tools:** MySQL Workbench / Command Line

## 📁 Files
- `Carbon Emission Analysis.sql` – Full SQL queries including database creation, table creation, data loading, cleaning, and analysis.

## ✅ Outcome
Performed detailed SQL-based analysis to understand global carbon emission trends, top contributors, and reduction strategies, laying a foundation for policy-making and environmental insights.
